Steps to obtain a CTF flag:

-> Import the  QuantumCircuit and transpile modules from the Qiskit package, AerSimulator module from the qiskit.providers.aer package and the long_to_bytes, bytes_to_long methods from the Crypto.Util.number package.

-> Reads the quantum circuit from a QASM file located at the specified file path and stores it in a variable called file.

-> Create a QuantumCircuit object called qtc by parsing the QASM code stored in the file variable using the from_qasm_str() method.

-> qtc.measure_all(): Add a measurement gate to each qubit in the circuit to obtain the final measurement outcome.

-> stabilizer_simulator = AerSimulator(method='stabilizer'): Create an instance of the AerSimulator backend that simulates a stabilizer circuit.

-> tc = transpile(qtc, stabilizer_simulator): This line transpiles the qtc circuit for the stabilizer_simulator backend.

-> stabilizer_result = stabilizer_simulator.run(tc, shots=1).result(): this runs the transpiled circuit on the stabilizer_simulator backend with a single shot and obtains the result.

-> res = stabilizer_result.get_counts(): This line extracts the counts of each measurement outcome from the result.

-> flag = long_to_bytes(flag): and converts the integer flag to a byte string using the long_to_bytes function from the Crypto library.

-> print(flag): This line prints the flag obtained from the quantum circuit.
